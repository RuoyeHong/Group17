Animal shelter is one of the most important in society. It provides a home for homeless animals and provides treatments for injured animals. For the space of animal shelter is limited and the requirements always exceed the animal shelter supply. We try to study the factors influencing the time that animals stayed at shelter.


The Dataset obtained from Dallas animal shelter. This Dataset includes 7 attributes Animal Type,Month(of admission), Year(of admission), Intake type(reason for admission), Outcome type( outcome for the animal), Chip status(whether animals have chip or not) and Time at shelter(time spent in the shelter).
This report is to estimate a relationship between variables and Time at shelter using Generalised Linear Model. During the exploration analytics, we used the boxplot to find the outliers and the column diagram was used to see the distribution of the data. We used some methods to work with data. Then we checked the mean and variance of the data and analyzed the type of outcome data. Finally we chose the best fitting model for data. The details about exploration are provided in the Rmd file.
