# Group17
The Dataset obtained from Dallas animal shelter. This Dataset includes 7 attributes Animal Type,Month(of admission), Year(of admission), Intake type(reason for admission), Outcome type( outcome for the animal), Chip status(did animal had chip) and Time at shelter(time spend in the shelter)
The report study the factors influencing the time at shelter before the Outcome Type is decided. The variable which would be considered while modelling response are Animal_type, Month, Intake_type and Chip_status. We are dropping year and Outcome_type cause most data are from 2017 which might not affect time at shelter and Outcome_type as Time at Shelter is decided before Outcome_type(no affect on response).

This report to estimate a relationship between variable and Time at shelter using Generalised Linear Model.
